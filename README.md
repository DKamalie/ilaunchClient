Zul File
- The layout is built as close to the provided image show casing the crud system.

Personal Challenges with ZK
- My intention was to provide data to the zul file from the backend server. The backend server API works well, the only issue is that due to lack of exposure to the ZK framework and its large library of components, I found it difficult to consume the API with ZKs mvm or mvvm pattern.
- There was alot of time spent on fixing missing ZK dependencies and plugin versions, despite using various ZK archetypes. The reason this had to be fixed was so that I could package a WAR file. This was fixed, and War files are available.

DATA
- Even though I've built a backend server api using a database for the purpose of adding dynamic data, consuming the api was a bit difficult due to lack of exposure to the zk framework.
- Currently, the zul file only displays static data. Therefore, adding pagination was not necessarily possible with rows.
